1. Define DB and connection

2. Design DB schema
- "measurements" table will have a separate row for each variable measured even when the timestamp is the same. Needs to be like this assuming we don't know ahead of time how many variables there can be, and what those are therefore it needs to be dynamic.

3. Make a migration to create required tables

4. Create seed script to import data from CSV to DB

5. Create models for getting required data from DB
- Up to here

6. Create endpoint to list all weather stations
